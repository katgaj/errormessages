# Types of error messages #

Jakob Nielson distinguishes between two types of errors: **slips** and **mistakes**. Slips are unintentional (right intent, wrong action), while mistakes are described as wrong intent.

A slip may happen to both epxerienced and unexperienced user. It can be a spelling mistake or putting data in the wrong box. They come up when the user is not paying attention to their actions or they are doing their tasks on autopilot.. Slips are easy to eliminate: just write the word correctly or put the number in the correct field. 

Mistakes are commited intentionally in a situation when the user does not understand how the product works and makes mistakes to figure out how to complete the process. (MADCAP!!!!)
