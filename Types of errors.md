Jakob Nielson distinguishes between two types of errors: **slips** and **mistakes**. Slips are unintentional (right intent, wrong action), while mistakes are described as wrong intent.

A slip pmay happen to both epxerienced and unexperienced user. It can be a spelling mistake or puttinf data in the wrong box. slips are easy to eliminate: write the word correctly or put the number in rthe correct field. 

Mistakes are commited intentionally in a situation when the user does not understand how the product works and makes mistakes to figure out how to complete the process. (MADCAP!!!!)
