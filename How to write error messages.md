The basic idea is to think of potential errors during the process of creating the application and not after it is implemented. This will help you prepare different scenarios for various error situations. What is more, you may even be able to eliminate errogenic situations from your product.

You have to make it clear that the error occured (visibility of system status). 
Give solution and explain what happened. It is critical for the user to deal with the problem first.

"Error messages should be expressed in **plain language** (no error codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution.

As Wojciech Aleksander points out in his "UX writing. Moc języka w produktach cyfrowych",when you write an error message it is best to use *inverted pyramid*:

The most improtant information is how to solve the problem.

Then you can explain what happened, and finally, you may provide the user with some details, eg. what brought the error about.

These error messages should also be presented with visual treatments that will help users notice and recognize them." (Nielsen)

"Text and highlights that are bold, high-contrast, and red are conventional error-message visuals. Use this styling for the message and for the affected elements needing correction. Another technique for improving noticeability is leveraging carefully designed animations to guide the user's visual attention for corrections. Remember accessibility guidelines to aid the roughly 350 million people worldwide with a color-vision deficiency, and never use exclusively color or animation to indicate errors."
