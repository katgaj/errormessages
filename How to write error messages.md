The basic idea is to think of potential errors during the process of creating the application and not after it is implemented. This will help you prepare different scenarios for various error situations. What is more, you may even be able to eliminate errogenic situations from your product.

You have to make it clear that the error occured (visibility of system status). 
Give solution and explain what happened. It is critical for the user to deal with the problem first.

These error messages should also be presented with visual treatments that will help users notice and recognize them." (Nielsen)
