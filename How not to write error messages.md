   1. **Never blame the user**. You create the product so you are responsible for any mistakes that the user will encounter.

Avoid messages like these:

The user is already frustrated.

The better option is to acknowledge that the problem evoked on your side, which is, in fact, true.

It is your job to work on the product to eliminate as many error.... scenarios as possible.

2.  Beware of **the "curse of knowledge"**. You cannot assume that the ordinary person is as acquainted with technical jargon as you are. Also, they may not have the suitable computer literacy or even may not be literate enough to understand complex messages

3. Avoid **capital letters**, they are is considered to be rude, and can be interpreted as shouting at someone. The whole experience with the error message is already frustrating for the user, there is no need to aggreviate this feeling. 

The same applies to the words such as *error*, *mistake*, *warning*, or any other words that can  raise the user's feeling of anxiety (*illegal*, *invalid*, *incorrect* are not preferable optioms either).

4. Do not use **humor**
